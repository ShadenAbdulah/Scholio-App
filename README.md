## App Structure and Navigation

Scholio utilizes a tab-based navigation system, providing quick access to core functionalities. The application features a persistent bottom navigation bar with four main tabs:

- **Home:** this tab serves as the main dashboard, offering an overview for the student.

- **Courses:** this tab allows students to view and manage their enrolled courses.

- **Calendar:** this tab is presumably for viewing schedules, deadlines, and events.

- **Profile:** this tab is expected to contain student-specific information and settings.


## Home Screen UI

The Home screen offers a quick overview of key information and easy access to features, enhancing the user experience.

It includes four quick-access icons for:

• **Course Registration:** For enrolling in courses.  
• **Grades:** Access to academic performance.  
• **Invoices:** Viewing payment information.  
• **Other:** Additional features or settings.

The central "My Courses" section displays a horizontally scrollable carousel of course cards for easy browsing. At the bottom, an "Announcement" section shows important messages or updates from the institution.

## Courses Screen UI

The **"Courses"** screen provides a comprehensive view of all courses the student is enrolled in. This screen can be accessed either by tapping the **"Courses"** tab in the bottom navigation bar or by clicking the "See All" link within the "My Courses" section on the Home screen.

A prominent **search bar** is located at the top of the course list, enabling students to quickly find specific courses by typing keywords. Below the search bar, courses are listed as individual cards, each presenting key information relevant to that course.
